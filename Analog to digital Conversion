Basic Element of Signal Processing Unit

What is signal Processing 
 - Field of science involves manipulation of signal to get desired shape. Transform from time domaine to frequency (vice versa )
 - Signal exist in nature are continuous interval (t1 - t2 ) Interval can range from -infinity to infinity
